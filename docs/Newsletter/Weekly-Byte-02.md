This Week‚Äôs Byte ‚Äì April 24, 2025

### **üíº Got a Job in Tech? Here‚Äôs What No One Tells You**

If you recently landed a job in tech, Congratulations üéâ!

You earned it. Seriously, celebrate that win.

But here‚Äôs something I wish someone told me early on:

Don‚Äôt stay stuck in ‚Äúgrateful mode.‚Äù Yes, you‚Äôre thankful. But that doesn‚Äôt mean saying ‚Äúyes‚Äù to everything or following every task without asking _why_.

> Be intentional. Be strategic. Own your path.

Because with the rise of AI and unpredictable layoffs, you don‚Äôt want to wake up years later and realize you were busy... but not growing.

Keep asking:

- Are you building the right skills?
- Are you learning how to solve real problems?
- Are you working on things that matter to _you_?

üéØ **Reminder:**

> ‚ÄúWhen writing the story of your life, don't let anyone else hold the pen.‚Äù

Meanwhile me, who ruing his life in own style. Xd!

### **üìö Top 4 Regrets before Dying**

A gentle reminder that we‚Äôre not just here to work. Life has more to offer, and these are the top regrets people have near the end:

1. **Not living the life, they truly wanted** ‚Äî They lived someone else‚Äôs dream.
2. **Working too hard** ‚Äî Missed the little joys and big moments.
3. **Not expressing how they felt** ‚Äî Love, anger, fear... all left unsaid.
4. **Losing touch with friends** ‚Äî Relationships faded away silently.

Let‚Äôs not wait until it's too late to do something about these.

### **‚ö†Ô∏è Why Developers Struggle with Focus (and What You Can Do About It)**

A normal 5-minute break also can cost you a huge recovery time.

The difference between when switches between multiple things rather focusing only one thing at a time

Read this article: üß† [**Context-switching is killing your productivity**](https://newsletter.techworld-with-milan.com/p/context-switching-is-the-main-productivity?ref=dailydev). And it‚Äôs _very real_.

If you‚Äôre jumping between Slack messages, code, meetings, and side projects, your brain is getting tired way faster than you think. Reduce interruptions. Set boundaries. Deep work matters.

### **‚è≥ The Present vs. The Future**

> ‚ÄúThe present entertains. The future rewards.‚Äù

Who do you want to be?

- The person who only lives for _today_.
- Or the one who invests in _tomorrow_?

But Remember:

> Tomorrow doesn‚Äôt have more time than today.

### **üß† Interesting Facts:**

The letter **‚Äúe‚Äù** is the most commonly used letter in English ‚Äî found in **11% of all words**!

### **üß© The Zeigarnik Effect: Why Incomplete Tasks Haunt Us**

Psychology says:

> We remember **incomplete tasks**

This is called the **Zeigarnik Effect** ‚Äî and it can be both a blessing and a curse:

‚úîÔ∏è It motivates you to finish what you started.

‚ùå But it also creates mental clutter if you never finish, making it hard to focus on new things.

Tip: Keep your to-do list short and finish tasks one at a time.

Our brain may have a crush on Incomplete Tasks

### **üí∏ Freelancing Tips That Actually Work**

For all freelancers (or aspiring ones), here‚Äôs what‚Äôs working for most popular freelancers lately:

1. **Start with local businesses: Think** restaurants, shops, personal brands.
2. **Visibility = Clients**: Show your work. Post on social. Help in communities.
3. **Don‚Äôt work for free**: But offering a _tiny_ free trial/demo builds trust fast.
4. **Reach out directly:** Don‚Äôt wait. Provide value first, then ask for business.
5. **Never drop your price:** Instead, increase your _value_.
6. **Keep networking:** The grind is real, but so are the rewards.

Xd! Sorry I am not a freelancer expert. I just found this tip interesting from a video. Thought sharing to others.

### **üöÄ Want to Be a Senior Developer? Avoid These Mistakes**

I read an article this week that hit hard. Here are five things holding back most devs from becoming senior:

1. **Blind copy-pasting from AI**: Always understand the code before you reuse it.
2. **Ignoring system design & scalability**: Learn how real systems work and scale.
3. **Stopping your learning journey**: Skills = survival. Keep upgrading.
4. **Not taking ownership**: Don‚Äôt just finish tasks. Own the _whole_ problem.
5. **Poor communication**: Speak clearly. Explain your work. Ask for what you need.

(: Agree with the point. But All I am sharing knowledge of others.

### **üîß Tech Concept of the Week: Dependency Injection (DI)**

If you‚Äôre writing clean, testable code ‚Äî DI is your best friend.

### **What is Dependency Injection?**

**Dependency Injection is a design pattern** used to separate the creation of a dependency from the class that uses it.

- **"Dependency"** = any object your class needs to work (e.g., UserService depends on UserRepository).
- **"Injection"** = instead of creating it inside, you give (inject) the dependency from outside.

### **Why Use It?**

Let‚Äôs start with **why DI is better than using static objects** or new Something () everywhere:

DI is great!

![](https://media.licdn.com/dms/image/v2/D4D12AQFLYKunCQagIg/article-inline_image-shrink_1000_1488/B4DZZoNMawGgAU-/0/1745505012023?e=1755129600&v=beta&t=FlWOR6Odx6cR9HFPkOa2zN72qCcYuJq93Q3x-vDftR8)

**‚ùå Without DI (static-style, hardcoded**)

```
class UserController {
  private userService = new UserService(); // bad - tight coupling

  getUser() {
    return this.userService.getUser();
  }
}
```

- UserController is responsible for creating its own dependency.
- You can‚Äôt easily test UserController with a fake/mock UserService.

**‚úÖ With DI (constructor injection)**

```
class UserController {
  constructor(private userService: UserService) {}

  getUser() {
    return this.userService.getUser();
  }
}
```

- You give UserController a UserService, which could be real, fake, or a mock.
- Now UserController doesn‚Äôt care **how** UserService was created‚Äîjust that it works.

DI is a gem. Becoming a fan of it !

### **üéì Courses I Wish I Could Buy**

I recently explored the free preview of [**System Design Simplified by InterviewReady**](https://interviewready.io/course-page/system-design-course).

If system design intimidates you (like it did for me), this course really breaks it down step by step. Hoping I can buy the full version someday.

Why doesn't my bank balance support me?

### **üß† Mental Health Isn‚Äôt Optional**

Let‚Äôs be honest, we all struggle sometimes. But most of us ignore it.

This week, I found something that could help:

üëâ [**Free Mental Health Test ‚Äì LifeSpring Consultancy Limited**](https://www.lifespringint.com/mental-health-test/)

It‚Äôs quick. It‚Äôs free. And it might help you understand where you are mentally. They also offer therapy sessions and YouTube content that feels like a warm hug. Nothing is more important than your mental peace, don‚Äôt delay if you need help.

Take time and give all the online test! Let me know how your experience was!
