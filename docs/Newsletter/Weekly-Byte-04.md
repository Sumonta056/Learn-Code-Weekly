# **✨ Quotes to Keep in Mind**

This week, I came across some words that really stuck with me:

- **"Never complain, never explain."**
- **"Start small. Start messy. Start now."**
- *In life, you’ll meet two kinds of people, those who build you up and those who tear you down. In the end, you’ll thank them both.*
- *When nothing is certain, anything is possible. You can choose to be scared or excited.*

Don't know how all of thing quotes, align with my thoughts and life. I think I should apply the fourth one in life. If nothing is certain, why should I focus on what nothing can bring!

### **An Interesting Thought from Engineering Levels**

In tech industry, there are different level of software engineering position. but if you look deeply all the position task/job is same even if they are on different company but they go with the same mentality.

- 💻 **Junior Engineer**: "My job is to write code."
- 💻 **Mid-level Engineer**: "My job is to write, maintain, and test code."
- 💼 **Senior Engineer**: "I write, maintain, test, refactor, *and* delete code."
- 🧠 **Staff Engineer**: "I do all that also shape how we’ll build features in the next 12 months."

**The Main Fact:** Growth in tech isn’t just about coding better. It’s about thinking longer term and solving for the bigger picture.

### **🔍 Did you know?**

When you learn a skill, your brain reallocates neurons to that skill. When you stop using that skill (for extended periods of time), your brain doesn't waste those neurons. It reallocates them to something else.

Which is why blind people often hear better, because the neurons typically used for sight are used for hearing. It's called **neuroplasticity**.

### **📚 Articles I Found Worth Sharing**

I read a few articles this week that really stood out:

- [**16 API Terms You Should Know**](https://blog.amigoscode.com/p/16-api-terms-you-should-know?ref=dailydev)
- [**Don’t Do This if You Want Good Frontend Code**](https://www.frontendjoy.com/p/don-t-do-this-unless-you-want-sh-t-frontend-code)
- [**The 3 Types of Mentors Every Engineer Needs**](https://thehustlingengineer.substack.com/p/the-3-types-of-mentors-every-engineer)

### **What I Learned This Week**

Here are some practical habits I’ve been building to become a better frontend developer:

1. **Learn outside of work**: Tech moves fast. So should we.
2. **Work on different projects and skills every month:** At stage of AI, worst thing can be working on the same type of project over and over which slows your growth.
3. **Get enough rest**: The less sleep I get, the more bugs I ship 😅
4. **Stay in touch with what’s happening in the world:** Most developer who ignore change will eventually get replaced by it.
5. **Review others’ code**: You can learn countless patterns and tricks just by reviewing code.
6. **Teach what you learn**: "If you can't explain it simply, you don't understand it well enough.” — Albert Einstein
7. **Avoid tutorials and copy/pasting:** Instead of binge-watching, try to build something. Use tutorials only when you’re stuck.

### **Things I wish I knew Before:**

Difference between a Fixed & Growth Mindset

**❌ Fixed Mindset:**

- "I don’t know Python, so I’ll never be good at data."
- "I don’t get interesting tasks, so I can’t grow."

**✅ Growth Mindset:**

- "How can I start learning Python today?"
- "How can I find interesting challenges myself?"

### **Worked on Topics:**

This week I worked on a React component using **@tanstack/react-query** to fetch data from a public API. Here’s a quick snippet to help you get started with **smart caching and data refetching**:
