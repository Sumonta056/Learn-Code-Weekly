### **💬 Insight from a Senior Dev**

This week, a senior developer shared something that really stuck with me:

> Companies don’t just look for talented developers; they look for someone they can trust with their vision, their challenges, and their future. Talent is important, but trust is what truly builds lasting partnerships and drives success.

It made me reflect that skills get you in the room, but trust keeps you there.

Xd! I didn't mean that you need to be both talented as well as trustworthy

### **📜 Laws That Hit Hard**

I came across a few "laws" recently, and they've been echoing in my mind ever since:

1. **Murphy’s Law**: _Whatever can go wrong, will go wrong._
2. **Kidlin’s Law**: _If you can write the problem clearly, it’s already half solved._
3. **Falkland’s Law**: _If you don’t have to make a decision, don’t make it._ – Not every problem needs immediate action.

### **🧠 Human Mindset = Google?**

Have you ever noticed this about Google?

- Search “Is coffee good for health?” — you’ll see tons of articles saying yes.
- Now search “Is coffee bad for health?” — and boom, it’s all negatives.

Our brain works the same way.

> If you tell yourself, “I can’t do it,” your brain will come up with endless justifications. But if you say, “I can do it,” it will hand you a thousand reasons why you’re capable.

**Lesson? Convince your mind.** End of the day, all you have to convince you brain. Brain will automatically get thousands of reasons why you can do it!

Meanwhile my brain is already stuck on negative loop!

### **🌐 Cool Website I Found**

> 🔗 [**AlgoMaster.io**](http://algomaster.io/)

It’s a solid resource for brushing up on Low-Level Design — covering OOP, design patterns, and more. Worth bookmarking if you’re prepping for interviews!

### **🩺 Health Fact of the Week**

Did you know?

> If your snot turns yellow, it means your body is fighting off an infection. That yellow color? It’s from dead white blood cells doing their job as your immune defenders.

Our bodies are smarter than we give them credit for.

### **🚀 Tech Tips & Deployment Notes**

I recently deployed a full-stack project and here’s the stack I used:

- 🐘 **PostgreSQL Database** → [**Render**](https://render.com/)
- 🛠 **Node.js + TypeScript Backend** → [**Render Web Service**](https://render.com/)
- ⚛️ **React + TypeScript Frontend** → [**Vercel**](https://vercel.com/)

⚠️ While deploying in Vercel, I got an issue while refreshing a page, Vercel throws e not found error page. Page is okay but when you refresh any page, it will show error. That’s an interesting issue

> While fixing the issue, I realized Stack overflow is still much better than many of popular AI when solving any error cause, it’ shows a working solution every time.

Real developers still prefer stack overflow!

### **💡 What’s “Vibe Coding”?**

You may have seen this term around. So, what is it?

> Vibe Coding

I tried vibe coding for a week but somehow, I hate vibe coding because it destroys my thinking capabilities.

---

### **🔍 Did you know? What is pnpm ?**

> PNPM is faster and saves disk space. The extra P stands for Performant. Instead of adding all the dependencies to a single project, PNPM uses a symlink strategy to share dependencies across projects. That's it! That's all you need to know.

It’s a great alternative to NPM or Yarn, especially in monorepos. I am thinking of giving it a try in my next project. I will share how was the experience!

### **🧠 Quotes That Hit Me**

- _Wisdom is knowing what to change. Maturity is knowing what not to._
- _Losers scan every possibility and miss the mark. Winners lock onto the mark and ignore the noise._

### **🎥 Video I Liked**

> Feeling overwhelmed, overthinking, or stuck in a loop? This video is a must-watch:

### **💡 Interesting Fact!**

> 𝗦𝗼𝗳𝘁𝘄𝗮𝗿𝗲 𝗘𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿 != 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿

**Software Engineer == Problem Solver**

Don't attack problems with code. Try first to understand them from a business perspective and then a technical perspective. Remember, 𝗰𝗼𝗱𝗲 𝗶𝘀 𝗮 𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗯𝗶𝗹𝗶𝘁𝘆, 𝗻𝗼𝘁 𝗮𝗻 𝗮𝘀𝘀𝗲𝘁
