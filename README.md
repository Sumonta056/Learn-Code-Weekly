## About Me

Hello! I'm Sumonta Saha Mridul, a passionate developer and educator currently working as an Associate Software Engineer I at Cefalo Bangladesh Ltd. I created this newsletter to share knowledge and help others grow in their programming journey.

I also run a YouTube channel called **Learn and Code**, where I create content to help aspiring developers enhance their skills and find inspiration in their coding journey.

I believe that coding should be accessible to everyone, and my mission is to break down complex concepts into clear, practical knowledge you can apply immediately. When I'm not coding or creating content, you can find me [your hobbies/interests].

Let's learn together, one week at a time!
